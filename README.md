# Book Bot

My first Boot.dev guided project! 

Guided projects are designed to get you *out* of tutorial hell, by writing a ton of code and giving you challenges to solve on your own (you are given a few hints, but the rest is on you and Google).

## About Book Bot

"Book Bot" - a Python program that can analyze an entire book and print out an interesting statistical report. 

A few of the learning goals are:
- Configure a professional Python development environment on your local computer
- Deploy a Python project on your personal GitHub account
- Learn how to use a professional code editor (VS Code)
- Put your Python and Git skills to the test in a real project
